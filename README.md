# ☀ Analysis of Brisbane Photovoltaic Installation Data ☀

This repo contains all of the code and analysis relating to the excercise. I will iteratively add code and thoughts, then finally summarise my answers in the readme file. I think it makes the most sense to do this excercise in a Jupyter Notebook since python is my preferred language and also so that you can see my working and I can embed commentary as markdown.
