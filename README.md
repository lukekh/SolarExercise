# â˜€ Analysis of Brisbane Photovoltaic Installation Data

This repo contains all of the code and analysis relating to the excercise. My solutions can be found in [Exercise.ipynb](https://github.com/lukekh/SolarExercise/blob/main/Exercise.ipynb) and I've left my scratched workings in [Scratch_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/lukekh/SolarExercise/blob/main/Scratch_Analysis.ipynb) if you wanted to look at some of the things I printed out to get my head around the data.
